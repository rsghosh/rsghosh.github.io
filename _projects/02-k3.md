# Annex Gasherbrum (K3) Printer

The K3 is an open source 3D printer by
[Annex Engineering](http://annex.engineering). The project focuses on speed
while maintaining high print quality, with short belt paths and 4 motors for
movement in the X and Y axes.

This page highlights my main contributions to the K3 printer as a member of the
Annex Engineering dev team.

## Toolhead Collision Checker

When I joined the K3 project as a beta tester, the toolhead design had not been
finalized yet. The team had the following objectives:

1. Add a second part cooling fan
2. Add support for the [Quickdraw probe](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe)
3. Add support for the [Sherpa Mini extruder](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder)

The main difficulty in adding these features to the toolhead was getting
everything to fit in the limited space we had.

My first contribution was to make a collision-checking assembly in SolidWorks to
define the allowable space envelope for the toolhead. This assembly brings all
of the objects that could cause toolhead collision as close to the toolhead as
they will get. Rather than modeling the toolhead and then moving it to the min
and max positions on each axis to check for collisions on each side, all
possible collisions can be visualized at once during design. I used global
variables to define the position of the bed relative to the printer frame and
the "over-travel" in each direction (how far the nozzle will move beyond each
edge of the print bed). With the assembly parameterized, all the objects the
toolhead might collide with are re-positioned automatically whenever any of the
variables are changed. The image below shows the toolhead collision checker
assembly with my toolhead design inserted.

## Toolhead

Utilizing my collision checker assembly, I designed a new toolhead for the K3
printer to accomplish all three objectives. I was added to the Annex Engineering
dev team, and my design became the official toolhead for the K3 printer.

I later added additional configurations to the toolhead to support more
extruder and hotend options.

## Front Door Engraving

I designed the mountain graphic for K3's front door using SolidWorks and
Inkscape. Just like Annex's larger K2 printer, the graphic is derived from a 
3D model of the mountain that the printer is named after.

The final result is shown below:

{% endcapture %}
{% include elements/carousel-figure.html images=carousel_images ride="carousel" caption="Front Door Engraving" %}

The steps I used to create the graphic are shown below. I used SolidWorks to
create the "slices" from the mountain 3D model and to add the outline and text,
and I used Inkscape to add thickness to the mountain slice edges.

## Renders

I created renders for the K3 printer using Blender. These renders were used in
the [project readme](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/blob/main/README.md)
and in [Fabreeko product listings](https://www.fabreeko.com/collections/annex-engineering/products/annex-k3-kit-by-honeybadger).

The renders are shown below:
