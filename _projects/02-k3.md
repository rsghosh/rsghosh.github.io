# Annex Gasherbrum (K3) Printer

The K3 is an open source 3D printer by Annex Engineering. The project focuses
on speed while maintaining high print quality, with short belt paths and 4
motors for movement in the X and Y axes.

This page highlights my contributions to the K3 printer as a member of the Annex
Engineering dev team.

## Toolhead Collision Checker

When I initially joined the K3 project as a beta tester, the toolhead design had
not been finalized. The team wanted to add a second part cooling fan, add
support for the [Quickdraw probe](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe),
and add support for the [Sherpa Mini extruder](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder).
The main difficulty in adding these features to the toolhead was getting
everything to fit in the limited space we had.

One of my first contributions to the project was to make a collision-checking
assembly in SolidWorks to define the allowable space envelope for the toolhead.
This assembly brings all the objects the toolhead might collide with as close to
the toolhead as they will get. Rather than modeling the toolhead and then moving
it around to the min and max positions on each axis to check for collisions on
each side, all possible collisions can be visualized at once while designing the
toolhead. I used global variables to define the position of the bed relative to
the printer frame and the "over-travel" in each direction (how far the nozzle
will move beyond each edge of the print bed). With the assembly parameterized,
all the objects the toolhead might collide with are re-positioned automatically
whenever any of the variables are changed. The image below shows the toolhead
collision checker assembly with my toolhead design inserted.

## Toolhead

Utilizing my collision checker assembly, I designed a new toolhead for the K3
printer to accomplish the goals mentioned above. I was added to the Annex
Engineering dev team, and my design became the official toolhead for the K3
printer.

I later added additional configurations to the toolhead to support more
extruder and hotend options.

## Front Door Engraving

I designed the mountain graphic for K3's front door using SolidWorks and
Inkscape. Just like Annex's larger K2 printer, the graphic is derived from a 
3D model of the mountain that the printer is named after.

The final result is shown below:

{% endcapture %}
{% include elements/carousel-figure.html images=carousel_images ride="carousel" caption="Front Door Engraving" %}

The steps I used to create the graphic are shown below. I used SolidWorks to
create the "slices" from the mountain 3D model and to add the outline and text,
and I used InkScape to add thickness to the mountain slice edges.

## Renders

I created renders for the K3 printer using Blender. These renders were used in
the [project readme](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/blob/main/README.md)
and in [Fabreeko product listings](https://www.fabreeko.com/collections/annex-engineering/products/annex-k3-kit-by-honeybadger).
