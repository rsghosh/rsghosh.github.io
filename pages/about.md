# About Me

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**

I am a mechanical and software engineer with a passion for designing innovative
solutions that integrate mechanical components, electronics, and software.

I graduated from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo in
2023 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (concentration in Mechatronics) and a
minor in Computer Science.

I am proficient in SolidWorks for designing parts and assemblies, and FDM/FFF 3D
printers for rapid prototyping and iterative development.
